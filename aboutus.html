        <p>20 years ago, John and Jane Doe had a dream about selling old fashioned candy that tastes like good times. They gathered all of their savings together, and against all odds, bought their dream candy store. The town mayor was among the hundreds that witnessed the grand opening. Today, Caren's Candy stands proud as the most popular candy store in the state, thanks to its legendary selection and affordable prices.</p>
        <p>To find us, take a left facing the town office, and a right at the traffic light. About half a mile ahead, you'll see our sign on the right.</p>
